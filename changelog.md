# apollo-upload-client changelog

## 12.0.0

### Major

- Updated Node.js support from v8.5+ to v8.10+, to match what the [`eslint`](https://npm.im/eslint) dev dependency now supports. This is unlikely to be a breaking change for the published package.

### Patch

- Updated dev dependencies.
- Added the [`eslint-plugin-jsdoc`](https://npm.im/eslint-plugin-jsdoc) dev dependency.
- Replaced the [`size-limit`](https://npm.im/size-limit) dev dependency with [`@size-limit/preset-small-lib`](https://npm.im/@size-limit/preset-small-lib).
- Only create a default [`AbortController`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/AbortController) instance if `signal` is not already set in fetch options, fixing [#162](https://github.com/jaydenseric/apollo-upload-client/issues/162) via [#169](https://github.com/jaydenseric/apollo-upload-client/pull/169).
- Use GitHub Actions instead of Travis for CI.
- Clarified that Opera Mini isn’t supported in the Browserslist queries and readme “Support” section.
- Documented polyfills to consider in the readme “Support” section.
- Updated examples to use [`@apollo/react-hooks`](https://npm.im/@apollo/react-hooks).

## 11.0.0

### Major

- Updated Node.js support from v6+ to v8.5+.

### Minor

- Support [Apollo Engine client awareness](https://apollographql.com/docs/platform/client-awareness), via [#143](https://github.com/jaydenseric/apollo-upload-client/pull/143).

### Patch

- Updated dependencies.
- Ensure Babel helpers are imported and not inlined, using the [`@babel/runtime`](https://npm.im/@babel/runtime) dependency and [`@babel/plugin-transform-runtime`](https://npm.im/@babel/plugin-transform-runtime) dev dependency.
- Nicer Browserslist syntax for supported Node.js versions.

## 10.0.1

### Patch

- Updated dependencies.
- Reduced the size of the published `package.json` by moving dev tool config to files. This also prevents editor extensions such as Prettier and ESLint from detecting config and attempting to operate when opening package files installed in `node_modules`.
- Simplified the `prepublishOnly` script.
- Add tips for React Native gotchas, via [#135](https://github.com/jaydenseric/apollo-upload-client/pull/135).
- Updated the package description to mention that the upload link is terminating and clarified in the setup instructions that there can only be 1 terminating Apollo Link, via [#147](https://github.com/jaydenseric/apollo-upload-client/pull/147).
- Improve setup instructions for Apollo Boost.

## 10.0.0

### Major

- Updated the [`extract-files`](https://npm.im/extract-files) dependency to v5:
  - The original operation object is no longer modified when it contains files, fixing [#81](https://github.com/jaydenseric/apollo-upload-client/issues/81).
  - If the same file is used in multiple locations of an operation it is only uploaded once.

### Patch

- Updated dependencies.
- Updated package scripts and config for the new [`husky`](https://npm.im/husky) version.
- Updated Node.js and browser support documentation in the readme.
- Use [jsDelivr](https://jsdelivr.com) for the readme logo instead of [RawGit](https://rawgit.com) as they are shutting down.

## 9.1.0

### Minor

- Support more browsers by changing the [Browserslist](https://github.com/browserslist/browserslist) query from [`> 1%`](https://browserl.ist/?q=%3E+1%25) to [`> 0.5%, not dead`](https://browserl.ist/?q=%3E+0.5%25%2C+not+dead).

### Patch

- Updated dev dependencies.
- Fix Babel not reading from the package `browserslist` field due to [a sneaky `@babel/preset-env` breaking change](https://github.com/babel/babel/pull/8509), fixing [#124](https://github.com/jaydenseric/apollo-upload-client/issues/124).

## 9.0.0

### Major

- Made [`apollo-link`](https://npm.im/apollo-link) a dependency, instead of a peer dependency.
- Removed the package `module` entry and the "ESM" build, which was `.js` and not proper native ESM for Node.js via `.mjs` as Apollo dependencies don’t support it.

### Minor

- Updated Babel, removing the [`@babel/runtime`](https://npm.im/@babel/runtime) dependency.
- Package [marked side-effect free](https://webpack.js.org/guides/tree-shaking#mark-the-file-as-side-effect-free) for bundlers and tree-shaking.

### Patch

- Updated dependencies.
- Use the new [`extract-files`](https://npm.im/extract-files) API.
- Use [`jsdoc-md`](https://npm.im/jsdoc-md) to generate readme API docs from source JSDoc, which has been improved.
- Readme examples updated to use the [`react-apollo`](https://npm.im/react-apollo) `Mutation` component instead of the `graphql` decorator.
- Readme examples use CJS instead of ESM as this project does not support native ESM (due to a lack of support in Apollo dependencies) and we shouldn’t assume everyone uses Babel.
- Updated package description.
- Added package tags.
- Added a package `test:size` script, using [`size-limit`](https://npm.im/size-limit) to guarantee < 1 KB CJS bundle sizes.
- Lint `.yml` files.
- Refactored package scripts and removed the [`npm-run-all`](https://npm.im/npm-run-all) dev dependency.
- Removed a temporary workaround for [a fixed Babel CLI bug](https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/8077).
- Ensure the readme Travis build status badge only tracks `master` branch.
- Use [Badgen](https://badgen.net) for the readme npm version badge.

## 8.1.0

- Updated dependencies.
- Use `.prettierignore` to defer `package.json` formatting to npm.
- Renamed `.babelrc.js` to `babel.config.js` and simplified ESLint ignore config.
- Improved linting with [`eslint-config-env`](https://npm.im/eslint-config-env).
- Use the `.mjs` extension for source.
- Added JSDoc comments to source.
- Refactored package scripts:
  - Use `prepare` to support installation via Git (e.g. `npm install jaydenseric/apollo-upload-client`).
  - Remove `rimraf` and `cross-env` dev dependencies. Only \*nix environments will be supported for contributing.
  - Removed `watch` and `fix` scripts.
- Compact package `repository` field.
- Setup Travis CI.
- Readme badge changes to deal with [shields.io](https://shields.io) unreliability:
  - Removed the licence badge. The licence can be found in `package.json` and rarely changes.
  - Removed the Github issues and stars badges. The readme is most viewed on Github anyway.
  - Added the more reliable build status badge provided by Travis and placed it first as it loads the quickest.

## 8.0.0

- Abandon `.mjs` [until Apollo provides native ESM](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-link/issues/537), fixing [#72](https://github.com/jaydenseric/apollo-upload-client/issues/72).
- New readme logo URL that doesn’t need to be updated every version.

## 7.1.0

- Updated dependencies.
- Stop using named imports from CJS dependencies in ESM, fixing [#72](https://github.com/jaydenseric/apollo-upload-client/issues/72).
- Match an [error handling tweak](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-link/pull/524/files#diff-f34b7d587510bfca51f1dd1dd03dfc98R130) in the official HTTP links.

## 7.1.0-alpha.2

- Updated dependencies.
- Using new `apollo-link-http-common` API.
- Corrected aborting fetch, fixing [#70](https://github.com/jaydenseric/apollo-upload-client/issues/70).

## 7.1.0-alpha.1

- Updated dependencies.
- Using [`apollo-link-http-common`](https://npm.im/apollo-link-http-common) for commonality with the official HTTP links:
  - Removed `graphql` peer dependency.
  - Aborting `fetch` supported.

- HTTPS `package.json` author URL.

## 7.0.0-alpha.4

  - Misc. tweaks.

## 7.0.0-alpha.3

- Updated dependencies.
  - [`extract-files` v3](https://github.com/jaydenseric/extract-files/releases/tag/v3.0.0) replaces files extracted from properties with `null` instead of deleting the property; see [jaydenseric/extract-files#4](https://github.com/jaydenseric/extract-files/issues/4). This improves compliance with the [GraphQL multipart request spec](https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-multipart-request-spec). It’s not a breaking change for `apollo-upload-server`, but it might be for other implementations.

## 7.0.0-alpha.2

- Added a clean step to builds.
- Smarter Babel config with `.babelrc.js`.
- Modular project structure that works better for native ESM.

- Support [browsers with >1% global usage](http://browserl.ist/?q=%3E1%25) (was >2%).
- Updated the readme support section.

## 7.0.0-alpha.1
